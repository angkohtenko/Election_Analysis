# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
I was given a dataset of a recent local congressional election in Colorado to complete the audit of results:
- calculate the total number of votes
- get a complete list of candidates and counties
- calculate the total number of votes for each candidate and county
- calculate the percentage of votes each candidate and county
- determine the winner of the election based on popular vote and the county which had a largest number of votes
I've used Python 3.8.0 and Visual Studio Code to conduct the analysis.

## Election-Audit Results
I wrote a python script which retrieves data from [election_results.csv](https://github.com/angkohtenko/Election_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/election_results.csv) and saves the result of analysis to [election_analysis.txt](https://github.com/angkohtenko/Election_Analysis/blob/main/Analysis/election_analysis.txt) :
